# Other-programs
Some small programs, that I want to mention:

search_info.py - console tool, that shows, what data you can load from web pages, using Selenium.

grammatics_main.lsp - transform (non-)deterministic automaton into equivalent grammatics. Better to test on https://rextester.com/l/clisp.

expr.hs - an example how to calculate simple expressions using Haskell creating types tools. Launch "ghci expr.hs" and then enter "main" (edit your expression in main function).
